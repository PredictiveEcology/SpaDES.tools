\usage{
spread3(
  start,
  rasQuality,
  rasAbundance,
  advectionDir,
  advectionMag,
  meanDist,
  dispersalKernel = "exponential",
  sdDist = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{start}{Raster indices from which to initiate dispersal}

\item{rasQuality}{A raster with habitat quality. Currently, must
be scaled from 0 to 1, i.e., a probability of "settling"}

\item{rasAbundance}{A raster where each pixel represents the number
of "agents" or pseudo-agents contained. This number of agents, will
be spread horizontally, and distributed from each pixel
that contains a non-zero non NA value.}

\item{advectionDir}{A single number or \code{RasterLayer} in degrees from North = 0
(though it will use radians if all values are \code{abs(advectionDir) > 2 * pi)}.
This indicates the direction of advective forcing (i.e., wind).}

\item{advectionMag}{A single number or \code{RasterLayer} in distance units of the
\code{rasQuality}, e.g., meters, indicating the relative forcing that will
occur. It is imposed on the total event, i.e., if the \code{meanDist} is
\code{10000}, and \code{advectionMag} is \code{5000}, then the expected
distance (i.e., 63\% of agents) will have settled by \code{15000} map units.}

\item{meanDist}{A single number indicating the mean distance parameter in map units
(not pixels), for a negative exponential distribution
dispersal kernel (e.g., \code{dexp}). This will mean that 63% of agents will have
settled at this \code{meanDist} (still experimental)}

\item{dispersalKernel}{Currently character string, with either `exponential` or `weibull`.
If}

\item{sdDist}{A single number indicating the `sd` parameter of a 2 parameter `dispersalKernel`.
Defaults to `1`, which is the same as the `exponential` distribution.}

\item{plot.it}{Numeric. With increasing numbers above 0, there will be plots
produced during iterations. Currently, only 0, 1, or 2+ are distinct.}

\item{minNumAgents}{Single numeric indicating the minimum number of agents
to consider all dispersing finished. Default is 50}

\item{verbose}{Numeric. With increasing numbers above 0, there will be more
messages produced. Currently, only 0, 1, or 2+ are distinct.}

\item{saveStack}{If provided as a character string, it will save each iteration
as part of a \code{rasterStack} to disk upon exit.}

\item{skipChecks}{Logical. If `TRUE`, assertions will be skipped (faster, but could miss
problems)}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with all information used during the spreading
}
\description{
This is built with \code{\link{spread2}} and is still experimental.
This one differs from other attempts in that it treats the advection and
dispersal as mathematical vectors that are added together.
They are "rounded" to pixel centres.
