\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A \code{RasterLayer} or \code{SpatRaster} object. This defines the possible
locations for spreading events to start and spread into.
This can also be used as part of \code{stopRule}.}

\item{loci}{A vector of locations in \code{landscape}.
These should be cell indices.
If user has x and y coordinates, these can be converted
with \code{\link[terra:xyCellFrom]{cellFromXY()}}.}

\item{spreadProb}{Numeric, \code{RasterLayer}, or \code{SpatRaster}.
If numeric of length 1, then this is the global probability
of spreading into each cell from a neighbour.
If a raster (or a vector of length \code{terra::ncell(landscape)},
resolution and extent of \code{landscape}), then this will
be the cell-specific probability. Default is \code{0.23}.
If a \code{spreadProbLater} is provided, then this is
only used for the first iteration. Also called "escape
probability". See section on "Breaking out of spread events".}

\item{persistence}{A length 1 probability that an active cell will continue
to burn, per time step.}

\item{mask}{\code{RasterLayer} or \code{SpatRaster} object congruent with \code{landscape},
whose elements are \verb{0,1}, where \code{1} indicates "cannot spread to".
Currently not implemented, but identical behaviour can be
achieved if \code{spreadProb} has zeros in all unspreadable
locations.}

\item{maxSize}{Numeric. Maximum number of cells for a single or all events to be spread.
Recycled to match \code{loci} length, if it is not as long as \code{loci}.
See section on \verb{Breaking out of spread events}.}

\item{directions}{The number of adjacent cells in which to look;
default is 8 (Queen case). Can only be 4 or 8.}

\item{iterations}{Number of iterations to spread.
Leaving this \code{NULL} allows the spread to continue
until stops spreading itself (i.e., exhausts itself).}

\item{lowMemory}{Deprecated.}

\item{returnIndices}{Logical or numeric. If \code{1} or \code{TRUE}, will return a \code{data.table}
with indices and values of successful spread events.
If \code{2}, it will simply return a vector of pixel indices of
all cells that were touched. This will be the fastest option.
If \code{FALSE}, then it will return a raster with values.
See Details.}

\item{returnDistances}{Logical. Should the function include a column with the
individual cell distances from the locus where that event
started. Default is \code{FALSE}.
See Details.}

\item{mapID}{Deprecated. Use \code{id}.}

\item{id}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, returns a raster of events ids.
If \code{FALSE}, returns a raster of iteration numbers,
i.e., the spread history of one or more events.
NOTE: this is overridden if \code{returnIndices} is \code{TRUE}
or \code{1} or \code{2}.}

\item{plot.it}{If \code{TRUE}, then plot the raster at every iteration,
so one can watch the spread event grow.}

\item{spreadProbLater}{Numeric, or \code{RasterLayer}. If provided, then this
will become the \code{spreadProb} after the first iteration.
See Details.}

\item{spreadState}{\code{data.table}. This should be the output of a previous call
to \code{spread}, where \code{returnIndices} was \code{TRUE}.
Default \code{NA}, meaning the spread is starting from \code{loci}.
See Details.}

\item{circle}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then outward spread will be by
equidistant rings, rather than solely by adjacent cells
(via \code{directions} arg.). Default is \code{FALSE}.
Using \code{circle = TRUE} can be dramatically slower for large problems.
Note, this should usually be used with \code{spreadProb = 1}.}

\item{circleMaxRadius}{Numeric. A further way to stop the outward spread of events.
If \code{circle} is \code{TRUE}, then it will grow to this maximum radius.
See section on \verb{Breaking out of spread events}.
Default is \code{NA}.}

\item{stopRule}{A function which will be used to assess whether each
individual cluster should stop growing.
This function can be an argument of \code{"landscape"},
\code{"id"}, \code{"cells"}, and any other variables passed to
\code{spread} in the \code{...}. \code{cells} and \code{landscape} will both
be numeric vectors of length of active cells. \code{cells} will
be the raster index, so can be used to extract values
from another raster passed via ... .
Default \code{NA}, meaning that spreading will not stop
as a function of the landscape.
See section on "Breaking out of spread events" and examples.}

\item{stopRuleBehavior}{Character. Can be one of \code{"includePixel"},
\code{"excludePixel"}, \code{"includeRing"}, or
\code{"excludeRing"}.
If \code{stopRule} contains a function, this argument is
used determine what to do with the cell(s) that caused
the rule to be \code{TRUE}. See details.
Default is \code{"includeRing"} which means to accept the
entire ring of cells that caused the rule to be \code{TRUE}.}

\item{allowOverlap}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then individual events can overlap
with one another, i.e., they do not interact (this is slower
than if \code{allowOverlap = FALSE}).
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{asymmetry}{A numeric indicating the ratio of the asymmetry to be used.
Default is \code{NA}, indicating no asymmetry.
See details. This is still experimental.
\strong{Use with caution.}}

\item{asymmetryAngle}{A numeric indicating the angle in degrees (0 is "up",
as in North on a map), that describes which way the \code{asymmetry} is.}

\item{quick}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then several potentially time consuming
checking (such as \code{inRange}) will be skipped.
This should only be used if there is no concern about checking
to ensure that inputs are legal.}

\item{neighProbs}{A numeric vector, whose sum is 1.
It indicates the probabilities an individual spread iteration
spreading to \code{1:length(neighProbs)} neighbours.}

\item{exactSizes}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the \code{maxSize} will be
treated as exact sizes, i.e., the spread events will continue
until they are \code{floor(maxSize)}.
This is overridden by \code{iterations}, but if \code{iterations}
is run, and individual events haven't reached \code{maxSize},
then the returned \code{data.table} will still have at least
one active cell per event that did not achieve \code{maxSize},
so that the events can continue if passed into \code{spread}
with \code{spreadState}.}

\item{relativeSpreadProb}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then \code{spreadProb} will
be rescaled \emph{within} the \code{directions} neighbours, such that
the sum of the probabilities of all neighbours will be 1. Default
\code{FALSE}, unless \code{spreadProb} values are not contained
between 0 and 1, which will force \code{relativeSpreadProb}
to be \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Additional named vectors or named list of named vectors
required for \code{stopRule}. These
vectors should be as long as required e.g., length
\code{loci} if there is one value per event.}

\item{maintainExpectedSize}{Logical. Default \code{FALSE}, which is "normal" \code{spread}
behaviour. If \code{TRUE}, \code{spread} will rescale the \code{spreadProb} when there are
\code{NA} cells in the \code{adj} neighbours, such that in each iteration,
from each "spread from" pixel, the effective \code{spreadProb} is equal to what it
would have been if all \code{neighbours} existed. See below for explanation.}
}
\value{
Either a \code{RasterLayer} indicating the spread of the process in
the landscape or a \code{data.table} if \code{returnIndices} is \code{TRUE}.
If a \code{RasterLayer}, then it represents
every cell in which a successful spread event occurred. For the case of, say, a fire
this would represent every cell that burned. If \code{allowOverlap} is \code{TRUE},
This \code{RasterLayer} will represent the sum of the individual event ids
(which are numerics \code{seq_along(loci)}.
This will generally be of minimal use because it won't be possible to distinguish
if event 2 overlapped with event 5 or if it was just event 7.

If \code{returnIndices} is \code{TRUE},
then this function returns a \code{data.table} with columns:

\tabular{ll}{
\code{id} \tab an arbitrary ID \code{1:length(loci)} identifying
unique clusters of spread events, i.e., all cells
that have been spread into that have a
common initial cell.\cr
\code{initialLocus} \tab the initial cell number of that particular
spread event.\cr
\code{indices} \tab The cell indices of cells that have
been touched by the spread algorithm.\cr
\code{active} \tab a logical indicating whether the cell is active (i.e.,
could still be a source for spreading) or not (no
spreading will occur from these cells).\cr
}

This will generally be more useful when \code{allowOverlap} is \code{TRUE}.
}
\description{
This can be used to simulate fires, seed dispersal, calculation of iterative,
concentric landscape values (symmetric or asymmetric) and many other things.
Essentially, it starts from a collection of cells (\code{loci}) and spreads
to neighbours, according to the \code{directions} and \code{spreadProb} arguments.
This can become quite general, if \code{spreadProb} is 1 as it will expand
from every loci until all cells in the landscape have been covered.
With \code{id} set to \code{TRUE}, the resulting map will be classified
by the index of the cell where that event propagated from.
This can be used to examine things like fire size distributions.
\strong{NOTE:} See also \code{\link[=spread2]{spread2()}}, which is more robust and can be
used to build custom functions.
However, under some conditions, this \code{spread} function is faster.
The two functions can accomplish many of the same things, and key differences are internal.
}
\details{
For large rasters, a combination of \code{lowMemory = TRUE} and
\code{returnIndices = TRUE} or \code{returnIndices = 2}
will be fastest and use the least amount of memory.
\strong{2022-07-25: \code{lowMemory = TRUE} is deprecated due to removal of package \code{ffbase} from CRAN.}

This function can be interrupted before all active cells are exhausted if
the \code{iterations} value is reached before there are no more active
cells to spread into. If this is desired, \code{returnIndices} should be
\code{TRUE} and the output of this call can be passed subsequently as an input
to this same function. This is intended to be used for situations where external
events happen during a spread event, or where one or more arguments to the spread
function change before a spread event is completed. For example, if it is
desired that the \code{spreadProb} change before a spread event is completed because,
for example, a fire is spreading, and a new set of conditions arise due to
a change in weather.

\code{asymmetry} is currently used to modify the \code{spreadProb} in the following way.
First for each active cell, spreadProb is converted into a length 2 numeric of Low and High
spread probabilities for that cell:
\verb{spreadProbsLH <- (spreadProb*2) // (asymmetry+1)*c(1,asymmetry)},
whose ratio is equal to
\code{asymmetry}.
Then, using \code{asymmetryAngle}, the angle between the
initial starting point of the event and all potential
cells is found. These are converted into a proportion of the angle from
\code{-asymmetryAngle}
to
\code{asymmetryAngle}
using:
\code{angleQuality <- (cos(angles - rad2(asymmetryAngle))+1)/2}
where \code{rad2 <- function (degree) (degree * pi)/180}

These are then converted to multiple \code{spreadProbs} by
\code{spreadProbs <- lowSpreadProb + (angleQuality * diff(spreadProbsLH))}
To maintain an expected \code{spreadProb} that is the same as the asymmetric
\code{spreadProbs}, these are then rescaled so that the mean of the
asymmetric spreadProbs is always equal to spreadProb at every iteration:
\code{spreadProbs <- spreadProbs - diff(c(spreadProb, mean(spreadProbs)))}
}
\section{Breaking out of spread events}{


There are 4 ways for the spread to "stop" spreading. Here, each "event" is defined as
all cells that are spawned from a single starting loci. So, one spread call can have
multiple spreading "events". The ways outlines below are all acting at all times,
i.e., they are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, it is the user's
responsibility to make sure the different rules are interacting with
each other correctly. Using \code{spreadProb} or \code{maxSize} are computationally
fastest, sometimes dramatically so.

\tabular{ll}{
\code{spreadProb} \tab Probabilistically, if spreadProb is low enough,
active spreading events will stop. In practice,
active spreading events will stop. In practice,
this number generally should be below 0.3 to actually
see an event stop\cr
\code{maxSize} \tab This is the number of cells that are "successfully" turned
on during a spreading event. This can be vectorized, one value
for each event   \cr
\code{circleMaxRadius} \tab If \code{circle} is TRUE, then this will be the maximum
radius reached, and then the event will stop. This is
vectorized, and if length is >1, it will be matched
in the order of \code{loci}\cr
\code{stopRule} \tab This is a function that can use "landscape", "id", "cells",
or any named vector passed into \code{spread} in the \code{...}.
This can take on relatively complex functions.
Passing in, say, a \code{RasterLayer} to \code{spread}
can access the individual values on that arbitrary
\code{RasterLayer} using "cells".
These will be calculated within all the cells of the individual
event (equivalent to a "group_by(event)" in \code{dplyr}.
So, \code{sum(arbitraryRaster[cells])} would sum up all
the raster values on the \code{arbitraryRaster} raster
that are overlaid by the individual event.
This can then be used in a logical statement. See examples.
To confirm the cause of stopping, the user can assess the values
after the function has finished.\cr
}

The spread function does not return the result of this \code{stopRule}.
If, say, an event has both \code{circleMaxRadius} and \code{stopRule},
and it is the \code{circleMaxRadius} that caused the event spreading to stop,
there will be no indicator returned from this function that indicates
which rule caused the stop.

\code{stopRule} has many use cases. One common use case is evaluating
a neighbourhood around a focal set of points. This provides,
therefore, an alternative to the \code{\link[terra:buffer]{terra::buffer()}} function or
\code{\link[terra:focal]{terra::focal()}} function.
In both of those cases, the window/buffer size must be an input to the function. Here,
the resulting size can be emergent based on the incremental growing and calculating
of the \code{landscape} values underlying the spreading event.
}

\section{\code{stopRuleBehavior}}{

This determines how the \code{stopRule} should be implemented. Because
spreading occurs outwards in concentric circles or shapes, one cell width at a time, there
are 4 possible ways to interpret the logical inequality defined in \code{stopRule}.
In order of number of cells included in resulting events, from most cells to fewest cells:
}

\section{\code{maintainExpectedSize}}{

When there are \code{NA} cells in a \code{landscape}, there are two possible options for how
to deal with those. First, the default, is just treat them as places where the spreading
cannot occur. The effect will be that a landscape with many \code{NA} values will have
a smaller expected number of pixels spread to, for a given \code{spreadProb}. In the
case of fires, this would create a landscape with fewer and smaller fires, for the same
\code{spreadProb}. This is not always the behaviour that is desired. If \code{maintainExpectedSize = TRUE},
each iteration will adjust the \code{spreadProb} such that the expected number of cells
spread to will be equal to the expected number of all \code{neighbours} (i.e., 8) cells.
For example, if we have a pixel that is spreading to its 8 neighbours, and \code{spreadProb = 0.23}
in all 8 neighbour cells, the expected number of cells spread to is \code{0.23 * 8 = 1.84}.
If there are 2 \code{NA} cells around an active cell, and \code{maintainExpectedSize = FALSE}, then
the expected number of cells spread to is \code{0.23 * 6 = 1.38}. If \code{maintainExpectedSize = TRUE},
each of the 6 neighbours will be rescaled to \code{0.23 * 8/6 = 0.306667}, where \code{8} is the
number of possible pixels to spread to and 6 is the number of non-NA pixels that
are available among those \code{8}. The result is that the expected event size will
be the same as if there were no \code{NA} pixels.

\tabular{ll}{
\code{"includeRing"} \tab Will include the entire ring of cells that, as a group,
caused \code{stopRule} to be \code{TRUE}.\cr
\code{"includePixel"} \tab Working backwards from the entire ring that caused the
\code{stopRule} to be \code{TRUE}, this will iteratively
random cells in the final ring
until the \code{stopRule} is \code{FALSE}. This will add back
the last removed cell and include it in the return result
for that event.\cr
\code{"excludePixel"} \tab Like \code{"includePixel"}, but it will not add back the cell
that causes \code{stopRule} to be \code{TRUE}\cr
\code{"excludeRing"} \tab Analogous to \code{"excludePixel"}, but for the entire final
ring of cells added. This will exclude the entire ring of cells
that caused the \code{stopRule} to be \code{TRUE}\cr

## Example with relativeSpreadProb ... i.e., a relative probability spreadProb
##  (shown here because because spreadProb raster is not a probability).
##  Here, we force the events to grow, choosing always 2 neighbours,
##  according to the relative probabilities contained on hab layer.
##
## Note: `neighProbs = c(0,1)` forces each active pixel to move to 2 new pixels
## (`prob = 0` for 1 neighbour, `prob = 1` for 2 neighbours)
##
## Note: set hab3 to be very distinct probability differences, to detect spread
##  differences

\code{\link[=spread2]{spread2()}} for a different implementation of the same algorithm.
It is more robust, meaning, there will be fewer unexplainable errors, and the behaviour
has been better tested, so it is more likely to be exactly as described under all
argument combinations.
Also, \code{\link[=rings]{rings()}} which uses \code{spread} but with specific argument
values selected for a specific purpose.
\code{\link[terra:distance]{terra::distance()}}.
\code{\link[=cir]{cir()}} to create "circles"; it is fast for many small problems.
