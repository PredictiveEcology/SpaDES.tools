\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Required. A \code{RasterLayer} object. This defines the possible
locations for spreading events to start and spread2 into. Required.}

\item{start}{Required. Either a vector of pixel numbers to initiate spreading, or a
data.table that is the output of a previous \code{spread2}.
If a vector, they should be cell indices (pixels) on the \code{landscape}.
If user has x and y coordinates, these can be converted with
\code{\link[raster]{cellFromXY}}.}

\item{spreadProb}{Numeric of length 1 or length \code{ncell(landscape)} or
a \code{RasterLayer} that is the identical dimensions as
\code{landscape}.
If numeric of length 1, then this is the global (absolute)
probability of spreading into each cell from a neighbour.
If a numeric of length \code{ncell(landscape)} or a raster,
then this must be the cell-specific (absolute)
probability of a "receiving" potential cell. Default is \code{0.23}.
If relative probabilities are required, use \code{spreadProbRel}.
If used together, then the relative probabilities will be
re-scaled so that the mean relative probability of potential
neighbours is equal to the mean of \code{spreadProb} of
the potential neighbours.}

\item{persistProb}{Numeric of length 1 or \code{RasterLayer}.
If numeric of length 1, then this is the global (absolute)
probability of cell continuing to burn per time step.
If a raster, then this must be the cell-specific (absolute)
probability of a fire persisting.
Default is \code{NA}, which is the same as 0, i.e. a cell only burns
for one time step.}

\item{asRaster}{Logical, length 1. If \code{TRUE}, the function will return a \code{Raster}
where raster non NA values indicate the cells that were "active", and the
value is the initial starting pixel.}

\item{maxSize}{Numeric. Maximum number of cells for a single or
all events to be spread2. Recycled to match \code{start} length,
if it is not as long as \code{start}. This will be overridden if
\code{exactSize} also provided.
See section on \code{Breaking out of spread2 events}.}

\item{exactSize}{Numeric vector, length 1 or \code{length(start)}.
Similar to \code{maxSize}, but these will be the exact
final sizes of the events.  i.e., the spread2 events
will continue until they are \code{floor(exactSize)}.
This will override \code{maxSize} if both provided.
See Details.}

\item{directions}{The number adjacent cells in which to look;
default is 8 (Queen case). Can only be 4 or 8.}

\item{iterations}{Number of iterations to spread2.
Leaving this \code{NULL} allows the spread2 to continue
until stops spreading itself (i.e., exhausts itself).}

\item{returnDistances}{Logical. Should the function include a column with the
individual cell distances from the locus where that event
started. Default is FALSE. See Details.}

\item{returnDirections}{Logical. Should the function include a column with the
individual directions (in radians) from the locus where
that event started. Default is FALSE.}

\item{returnFrom}{Logical. Should the function return a column with the
source, i.e, the lag 1 "from" pixel, for each iteration.}

\item{maxRetriesPerID}{Only active if \code{exactSize} is used. This is the number of attempts
that will be made per event ID, before abandoning, therefore completing
the spread2 for that event with a size that is smaller than
\code{exactSize}. Default 10 times.}

\item{spreadProbRel}{Optional \code{RasterLayer} indicating a surface of relative
probabilities useful when using \code{neighProbs} (which
provides a mechanism for selecting a specific number of
cells at each iteration).
This indicates the relative probabilities for the selection
of successful neighbours.
\code{spreadProb} will still be evaluated \emph{after}
the relative probabilities and \code{neighProbs} has been
evaluated, i.e., potential cells will be identified, then
some could be rejected via \code{spreadProb}.
If absolute \code{spreadProb} is not desired,
\emph{be sure to set} \code{spreadProb = 1}.
Ignored if \code{neighProbs} is not provided.}

\item{plot.it}{If TRUE, then plot the raster at every iteration,
so one can watch the spread2 event grow.}

\item{circle}{Logical. If TRUE, then outward spread2 will be by equidistant rings,
rather than solely by adjacent cells (via \code{directions} arg.).
Default is \code{FALSE}.
Using \code{circle = TRUE} can be dramatically slower for large problems.
Note, this will likely create unexpected results if \code{spreadProb < 1}.}

\item{asymmetry}{A numeric or \code{RasterLayer} indicating the ratio of the
asymmetry to be used. i.e., 1 is no asymmetry; 2 means that the
angles in the direction of the \code{asymmetryAngle} are 2x the
\code{spreadProb}
of the angles opposite tot he \code{asymmetryAngle}  Default is
NA, indicating no asymmetry. See details. This is still experimental.
Use with caution.}

\item{asymmetryAngle}{A numeric or \code{RasterLayer} indicating the angle in degrees
(0 is "up", as in North on a map),
that describes which way the \code{asymmetry} is.}

\item{allowOverlap}{\code{numeric} (\code{logical} will work for backwards compatibility).
See details.  Default is 0, i.e., no overlapping.}

\item{neighProbs}{An optional numeric vector, whose sum is 1. It indicates the
probabilities that an individual
spread iteration will spread to \code{1, 2, ..., length(neighProbs)}
neighbours, respectively. If this is used (i.e., something other than
NA), \code{circle} and \code{returnDistances} will not work currently.}

\item{skipChecks}{Logical. If TRUE, the argument checking (i.e., assertions) will be
skipped. This should likely only be used once it is clear that the function
arguments are well understood and function speed is of the primary importance.
This is likely most useful in repeated iteration cases i.e., if this call
is using the previous output from this same function.}
}
\value{
Either a \code{data.table} (\code{asRaster=FALSE}) or a \code{RasterLayer}
(\code{asRaster=TRUE}, the default).
The \code{data.table} will have one attribute named \code{spreadState}, which
is a list containing a \code{data.table} of current cluster-level information
about the spread events.
If \code{asRaster=TRUE}, then the \code{data.table} (with its \code{spreadState}
attribute) will be attached to the \code{Raster} as an attribute named \code{pixel} as it
provides pixel-level information about the spread events.

The \code{RasterLayer} represents every cell in which a successful spread2 event occurred.
For the case of, say, a fire this would represent every cell that burned.
If \code{allowOverlap} is \code{TRUE}, the return will always be a \code{data.table}.

If \code{asRaster} is \code{FALSE}, then this function returns a
\code{data.table} with 3 (or 4 if \code{returnFrom} is \code{TRUE}) columns:

\tabular{ll}{
  \code{initialPixels} \tab the initial cell number of that particular
                           spread2 event.\cr
  \code{pixels} \tab The cell indices of cells that have
                       been touched by the spread2 algorithm.\cr
  \code{state} \tab a logical indicating whether the cell is active (i.e.,
                       could still be a source for spreading) or not (no
                       spreading will occur from these cells).\cr
  \code{from} \tab The pixel indices that were the immediately preceeding
                   "source" for each \code{pixels}, i.e., the lag 1 pixels.
                   Only returned if \code{returnFrom} is \code{TRUE} \cr
}

The attribute saved with the name "spreadState" (e.g., \code{attr(output, "spreadState")})
includes a \code{data.table} with columns:
\tabular{ll}{
  \code{id} \tab An arbitrary code, from 1 to \code{length(start)} for each "event".\cr
  \code{initialPixels} \tab the initial cell number of that particular
                           spread2 event.\cr
  \code{numRetries} \tab The number of re-starts the event did because it got
                         stuck (normally only because \code{exactSize} was used
                         and was not achieved.\cr
  \code{maxSize} \tab The number of pixels that were provided as inputs via
                     \code{maxSize} or \code{exactSize}.\cr
  \code{size} \tab The current size, in pixels, of each event.\cr
}
and several other objects that provide significant speed ups in iterative calls to
spread2. If the user runs \code{spread2} iteratively, there will likely be significant
speed gains if the \code{data.table} passed in to \code{start} should have the attribute
attached, or re-attached if it was lost, e.g., via
\code{setattr(outInput, "spreadState", attr(out, "spreadState"))}, where \code{out} is the
returned \code{data.table} from the previous call to \code{spread2}, and \code{outInput} is
the modified \code{data.table}. Currently, the modified \code{data.table} \bold{must} have the
same order as \code{out}.
}
\description{
This can be used to simulate fires, seed dispersal, calculation of iterative,
concentric, symmetric (currently) landscape values and many other things.
Essentially, it starts from a collection of cells (\code{start}, called "events")
and spreads to neighbours, according to the \code{directions}
and \code{spreadProb} with modifications due to other arguments. \bold{NOTE:}
the \code{spread} function is similar, but sometimes slightly faster, but less
robust, and more difficult to use iteratively.
}
\details{
There are 2 main underlying algorithms for active cells to "spread" to
nearby cells (adjacent cells): \code{spreadProb} and \code{neighProb}.
Using \code{spreadProb}, every "active" pixel will assess all
neighbours (either 4 or 8, depending on  \code{directions}), and will "activate"
whichever neighbours successfully pass independent calls to
\code{runif(1,0,1)<spreadProb}.
The algorithm will iterate again and again, each time starting from the newly
"activated" cells. Several built-in decisions are as follows.
1. no active cell can active a cell that was already activated by
the same event (i.e., "it won't go backwards"). 2. If \code{allowOverlap} is
\code{FALSE}, then the previous rule will also apply, regardless of which
"event" caused the pixels to be previously active.

This function can be interrupted before all active cells are exhausted if
the \code{iterations} value is reached before there are no more active
cells to spread2 into. The interrupted output (a data.table) can be passed
subsequently as an input to this same function (as \code{start}).
This is intended to be used for situations where external events happen during
a spread2 event, or where one or more arguments to the spread2 function
change before a spread2 event is completed.
For example, if it is desired that the \code{spreadProb} change before a
spread2 event is completed because, for example, a fire is spreading, and a
new set of conditions arise due to a change in weather.

\code{asymmetry} here is slightly different than in the \code{spread} function,
so that it can deal with a \code{RasterLayer} of \code{asymmetryAngle}.
Here, the \code{spreadProb} values of a given set of neighbours around each active pixel
are adjusted to create \code{adjustedSpreadProb} which is calculated maintain the
following two qualities: \deqn{mean(spreadProb) = mean(ajustedSpreadProb)} and
\deqn{max(spreadProb)/min(spreadProb) = asymmetry} along the axis of
\code{asymmetryAngle}. NOTE: this means that the 8 neighbours around an active
cell may not fulfill the preceeding equality if \code{asymmetryAngle} is not
exactly one of the 8 angles of the 8 neighbours. This means that
\deqn{max(spreadProb)/min(spreadProb)} will generally be less than
\code{asymmetry}, for the 8 neighbours. The exact adjustment to the spreadProb
is calculated with:
\deqn{angleQuality <- (cos(angles - rad(asymmetryAngle))+1)/2}
which is multiplied to get an angle-adjusted spreadProb:
\deqn{spreadProbAdj <- actualSpreadProb * angleQuality}
which is then rescaled:
\deqn{adjustedSpreadProb = (spreadProbAdj - min(spreadProbAdj)) * par2 + par1},
where par1 and par2 are parameters calculated internally to make the 2 conditions above true.



If \code{exactSize} or \code{maxSize} are used, then spreading will continue and stop
before or at \code{maxSize} or at \code{exactSize}. If \code{iterations} is specified,
then the function will end, and the returned \code{data.table} will still
may (if \code{maxSize}) or will (if \code{exactSize}) have at least one active
cell per event that did not already achieve \code{maxSize} or \code{exactSize}. This
will be very useful to build new, customized higher-level wrapper functions that iteratively
call \code{spread2}.
}
\note{
\code{exactSize} may not be achieved if there aren't enough cells in the map.
Also, \code{exactSize} may not be achieved because the active cells are "stuck",
i.e., they have no unactivated cells to move to; or the \code{spreadProb} is low.
In the latter two cases, the algorithm will retry again, but it will only
re-try from the last iterations active cells.
The algorithm will only retry 10 times before quitting.
Currently, there will also be an attempt to "jump" up to four cells away from
the active cells to try to continue spreading.

A common way to use this function is to build wrappers around this, followed
by iterative calls in a \code{while} loop. See example.
}
\section{Breaking out of spread2 events}{


There are 3 ways for the spread2 to "stop" spreading.
Here, each "event" is defined as all cells that are spawned from each unique
\code{start} location.
The ways outlined below are all acting at all times, i.e., they are not
mutually exclusive.
Therefore, it is the user's responsibility to make sure the different rules
are interacting with each other correctly.

\tabular{ll}{
  \code{spreadProb} \tab Probabilistically, if spreadProb is low enough,
                         active spreading events will stop. In practice,
                         this number generally should be below 0.3 to actually
                         see an event stop\cr
  \code{maxSize} \tab This is the number of cells that are "successfully" turned
                      on during a spreading event. \code{spreadProb} will still
                      be active, so, it is possible that the end size of each event
                      is smaller than \code{maxSize}, but they will not be greater
                      than \code{maxSize}\cr
  \code{exactSize} \tab This is the number of cells that are "successfully" turned
                      on during a spreading event. This will override an event that
                      stops probabilistically via \code{spreadProb}, but forcing
                      its last set of active cells to try again to find neighbours.
                      It will try \code{maxRetriesPerID} times per event, before giving up.
                      During those \code{maxRetriesPerID} times, it will try to "jump" up to
                      4 cells outwards from each of the active cells, every 5 retries.\cr
  \code{iterations} \tab This is a hard cap on the number of internal iterations to
                         complete before returning the current state of the system
                         as a \code{data.table}.\cr
}
}

\section{Building custom spreading events}{


This function can be used iteratively, with relatively little overhead compared to using
it non-iteratively. In general, this function can be called with arguments set as user
needs, and with specifying iterations = 1 (say). This means that the function will spread
outwards 1 iteration, then stop. The returned object will be a \code{data.table} or
\code{RasterLayer} that can be passed immediately back as the start argument into a subsequent
call to \code{spread2}. This means that every argument can be updated at each iteration.

When using this function iteratively, there are several things to keep in mind.
The output will likely be sorted differently than the input (i.e., the
order of start, if a vector, may not be the same order as that returned).
This means that when passing the same object back into the next iteration of the
function call, \code{maxSize} or \code{exactSize} may not be in the same order.
To get the same order, the easiest thing to do is sort the initial \code{start}
objects by their pixel location, increasing.
Then, of course, sorting any vectorized arguments (e.g., \code{maxSize}) accordingly.

\bold{NOTE}: the \code{data.table} or \code{RasterLayer} should not use be altered
when passed back into \code{spread2}.
}

\section{\code{allowOverlap}}{

If \code{1} (or \code{TRUE}),
 then individual events can overlap with one another, i.e., allow
 overlap between events. If \code{2} (or \code{NA}), then each pixel
 is essentially independent, allowing overlap between and within
 events. This likely requires a user to intervene as it is possible
 to spread back onto itself. If \code{3} (did not exist previously),
 individual events can overlap, and there can be overlap within an
 event, but only within an iteration, i.e., once an iteration is
 finished, and a pixel was activated, then the spreading will not
 return onto these pixels. If \code{0} (or \code{FALSE}), then once a
 pixel is activated, it cannot be re-activated, within or between event.
 This allows events to not interfere with one another i.e.,
 they do not interact (this is slower than if
 allowOverlap = FALSE). Default is 0. In the case of 2 or 3,
 this would be, perhaps, useful for dispersal of,
 say, insect swarms.
