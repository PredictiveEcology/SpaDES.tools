Plot2(...)

\item{...}{passed to \code{quickPlot::Plot}}

invoked for side effect of creating a plot.
}
\description{
During transition between \code{terra} and \code{raster}, and \code{sp} and \code{sf},
there are situations where we want to use Plot, but we have \code{SpatRaster} objects.
\code{quickPlot} is not yet fully functional for \code{SpatRaster} class yet.
This wrapper can be used.
}
\details{
A pass through for \code{Plot}, but with a conversion of \code{SpatRaster} to \code{RasterLayer}.
