\title{This is a very fast version of cir with allowOverlap = TRUE, allowDuplicates = FALSE,
returnIndices = TRUE, returnDistancse = TRUE, and includeBehaviour = "excludePixels".
It is used inside spread2, when asymmetry is active. The basic algorithm is to run cir
just once, then add to the xy coordinates of every locus}
\usage{
.cirSpecialQuick(landscape, loci, maxRadius, minRadius)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster on which the circles are built.}

\item{loci}{Numeric. An alternative to \code{coords}. These are the indices on
\code{landscape} to initiate this function. See \code{coords}. Default is one
point in centre of \code{landscape}..}

\item{maxRadius}{Numeric vector of length 1 or same length as coords}

\item{minRadius}{Numeric vector of length 1 or same length as \code{coords}. Default is
\code{maxRadius}, meaning return all cells that are touched
by the narrow ring at that exact radius. If smaller than \code{maxRadius},
then this will create a buffer or donut or ring.}
