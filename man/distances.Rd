\usage{
.pointDistance(
  from,
  to,
  angles = NA,
  maxDistance = NA_real_,
  otherFromCols = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{from}{Numeric matrix with 2 or 3 or more columns. They must include x and y,
representing x and y coordinates of "from" cell. If there is a column
named "id", it will be "id" from \code{to}, i.e,. specific pair distances.
All other columns will be included in the return value of the function.}

\item{to}{Numeric matrix with 2  or 3 columns (or optionally more, all of which
will be returned),
x and y, representing x and y coordinates of "to" cells, and
optional "id" which will be matched with "id" from \code{from}. Default is all cells.}

\item{angles}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the function will return angles in radians,
as well as distances.}

\item{maxDistance}{Numeric in units of number of cells. The algorithm will build
the whole surface (from \code{from} to \code{to}), but will
remove all distances that are above this distance.
Using this will keep memory use down.}
