\title{Download file from web databases}
\usage{
downloadFromWebDB(filename, filepath, dataset = NULL, quick = FALSE,
  overwrite = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{Character string naming the file to be downloaded.}

\item{filepath}{Character string giving the path where the file will be written.}

\item{dataset}{Optional character string representing the dataset of interest
for download. Allows for restricting the lookup for the url to a dataset,
thus avoiding filename collision.}

\item{quick}{Logical. This is passed internally to \code{\link{checksums}}
and \code{\link{downloadData}} (the quickCheck argument for both), and to
\code{\link{Cache}} (the quick argument). This results in faster, though
less robust checking of inputs. See the respective functions.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Should downloading and all the other actions occur
even if they pass the checksums or the files are all there.}
