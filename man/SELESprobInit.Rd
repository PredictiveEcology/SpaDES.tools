\title{\code{SELES} - Probability of Initiation}
\usage{
probInit(map, p = NULL, absolute = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{map}{A \code{spatialObjects} object. Currently, only provides CRS and, if p is not
a raster, then all the raster dimensions.}

\item{p}{probability, provided as a numeric or raster}

\item{absolute}{logical. Is \code{p} absolute probabilities or relative?}
}
\value{
A \code{RasterLayer} with probabilities of initialization.
There are several combinations of inputs possible and they each result
in different behaviours.

If \code{p} is numeric or \code{Raster} and between 0 and 1, it is treated as an
absolute probability, and a map will be produced with the p value(s) everywhere.

If \code{p} is numeric or \code{Raster} and not between 0 and 1, it is treated as a
relative probability, and a map will be produced with \code{p/max(p)} value(s) everywhere.

If \code{absolute} is provided, it will override the previous statements, unless
\code{absolute = TRUE} and p is not between 0 and 1 (i.e., is not a probability).
}
\description{
Describes the probability of initiation of agents or events.
\emph{THIS IS NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED.}

A \code{SELES}-like function to maintain conceptual backwards compatibility
with that simulation tool. This is intended to ease transitions from
\href{http://www.gowlland.ca/}{SELES}.

You must know how to use SELES for these to be useful.
