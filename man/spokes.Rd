\usage{
spokes(
  landscape,
  coords,
  loci,
  maxRadius = ncol(landscape)/4,
  minRadius = maxRadius,
  allowOverlap = TRUE,
  stopRule = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{Raster on which the circles are built.}

\item{coords}{Either a matrix with 2 (or 3) columns, \code{x} and \code{y} (and \code{id}), representing the
coordinates (and an associated id, like cell index),
or a \verb{SpatialPoints*} object around which to make circles. Must be same
coordinate system as the \code{landscape} argument. Default is missing,
meaning it uses the default to \code{loci}.}

\item{loci}{Numeric. An alternative to \code{coords}.
These are the indices on \code{landscape} to initiate this function (see \code{coords}).
Default is one point in centre of \code{landscape}.}

\item{maxRadius}{Numeric vector of length 1 or same length as \code{coords}}

\item{minRadius}{Numeric vector of length 1 or same length as \code{coords}. Default is
\code{maxRadius}, meaning return all cells that are touched
by the narrow ring at that exact radius. If smaller than \code{maxRadius},
then this will create a buffer or doughnut or ring.}

\item{allowOverlap}{Logical. Should duplicates across id be removed or kept. Default TRUE.}

\item{stopRule}{A function. If the spokes are to stop. This can be a function
of \code{landscape}, \code{fromCell}, \code{toCell}, \code{x}
(distance from coords cell), or any other named argument passed
into the \code{...} of this function. See examples.}

\item{includeBehavior}{Character string. Currently accepts only \code{"includePixels"}, the default,
and \code{"excludePixels"}. See details.}

\item{returnDistances}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then a column will be added to the returned
data.table that reports the distance from \code{coords} to every
point that was in the circle/doughnut surrounding \code{coords}.
Default \code{FALSE}, which is faster.}

\item{angles}{Numeric. Optional vector of angles, in radians, to use. This will create
"spokes" outward from \code{coords.} Default is \code{NA}, meaning, use internally
derived angles that will "fill" the circle.}

\item{nAngles}{Numeric, length one. Alternative to angles. If provided, the function
will create a sequence of angles from \code{0} to \code{2*pi},
with a length \code{nAngles}, and not including \code{2*pi}.
Will not be used if \code{angles} is provided, and will show
warning of both are given.}

\item{returnAngles}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then a column will be added to the returned
data.table that reports the angle from \code{coords} to every
point that was in the circle/doughnut surrounding \code{coords}. Default \code{FALSE.}}

\item{returnIndices}{Logical or numeric. If \code{1} or \code{TRUE}, will return a \code{data.table}
with indices and values of successful spread events.
If \code{2}, it will simply return a vector of pixel indices of
all cells that were touched. This will be the fastest option.
If \code{FALSE}, then it will return a raster with values.
See Details.}

\item{...}{Objects to be used by \code{stopRule()}. See examples.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing columns id (representing the row numbers of \code{coords}),
angles (from \code{coords} to each point along the spokes), x and y coordinates
of each point along the spokes, the corresponding indices on the \code{landscape}
Raster, dists (the distances between each \code{coords} and each point along the
spokes), and stop, indicating if it was a point that caused a spoke to stop
going outwards due to \code{stopRule}.
}
\description{
This is a generalized version of a notion of a viewshed.
The main difference is that there can be many "viewpoints".
