#' Simulate a contagious spread process on a landscape, with `data.table` internals
#'
#' This can be used to simulate fires, seed dispersal, calculation of iterative,
#' concentric, symmetric (currently) landscape values and many other things.
#' Essentially, it starts from a collection of cells (`start`, called "events")
#' and spreads to neighbours, according to the `directions`
#' and `spreadProb` with modifications due to other arguments. **NOTE:**
#' the `spread` function is similar, but sometimes slightly faster, but less
#' robust, and more difficult to use iteratively.
#'
#' There are 2 main underlying algorithms for active cells to "spread" to
#' nearby cells (adjacent cells): `spreadProb` and `neighProb`.
#' Using `spreadProb`, every "active" pixel will assess all
#' neighbours (either 4 or 8, depending on  `directions`), and will "activate"
#' whichever neighbours successfully pass independent calls to
#' `runif(1,0,1) < spreadProb`.
#' The algorithm will iterate again and again, each time starting from the newly
#' "activated" cells. Several built-in decisions are as follows.
#' 1. no active cell can activate a cell that was already activated by
#' the same event (i.e., "it won't go backwards"). 2. If `allowOverlap` is
#' `FALSE`, then the previous rule will also apply, regardless of which
#' "event" caused the pixels to be previously active.
#'
#' This function can be interrupted before all active cells are exhausted if
#' the `iterations` value is reached before there are no more active
#' cells to `spread2` into. The interrupted output (a `data.table`) can be passed
#' subsequently as an input to this same function (as `start`).
#' This is intended to be used for situations where external events happen during
#' a `spread2` event, or where one or more arguments to the `spread2` function
#' change before a `spread2` event is completed.
#' For example, if it is desired that the `spreadProb` change before a
#' `spread2` event is completed because, for example, a fire is spreading, and a
#' new set of conditions arise due to a change in weather.
#'
#' `asymmetry` here is slightly different than in the `spread` function,
#' so that it can deal with a `RasterLayer` of `asymmetryAngle`.
#' Here, the `spreadProb` values of a given set of neighbours around each active pixel
#' are adjusted to create `adjustedSpreadProb` which is calculated maintain the
#' following two qualities: \deqn{mean(spreadProb) = mean(ajustedSpreadProb)} and
#' \deqn{max(spreadProb)/min(spreadProb) = asymmetry} along the axis of
#' `asymmetryAngle`. NOTE: this means that the 8 neighbours around an active
#' cell may not fulfill the preceeding equality if `asymmetryAngle` is not
#' exactly one of the 8 angles of the 8 neighbours. This means that
#' \deqn{max(spreadProb)/min(spreadProb)} will generally be less than
#' `asymmetry`, for the 8 neighbours. The exact adjustment to the spreadProb
#' is calculated with:
#' \deqn{angleQuality <- (cos(angles - rad2(asymmetryAngle))+1)/2}
#' which is multiplied to get an angle-adjusted spreadProb:
#' \deqn{spreadProbAdj <- actualSpreadProb * angleQuality}
#' which is then rescaled:
#' \deqn{adjustedSpreadProb = (spreadProbAdj - min(spreadProbAdj)) * par2 + par1},
#' where `par1` and `par2` are parameters calculated internally to make the 2 conditions above true.
#'
#' @section Breaking out of `spread2` events:
#'
#' There are 3 ways for the `spread2` to "stop" spreading.
#' Here, each "event" is defined as all cells that are spawned from each unique
#' `start` location.
#' The ways outlined below are all acting at all times, i.e., they are not
#' mutually exclusive.
#' Therefore, it is the user's responsibility to make sure the different rules
#' are interacting with each other correctly.
#'
#' \tabular{ll}{
#'   `spreadProb` \tab Probabilistically, if `spreadProb` is low enough,
#'                          active spreading events will stop.
#'                          In practice, this number generally should be below 0.3
#'                          to actually see an event stop.\cr
#'   `maxSize` \tab This is the number of cells that are "successfully" turned
#'                       on during a spreading event. `spreadProb` will still
#'                       be active, so, it is possible that the end size of each event
#'                       is smaller than `maxSize`, but they will not be greater
#'                       than `maxSize`\cr
#'   `exactSize` \tab This is the number of cells that are "successfully" turned
#'                       on during a spreading event. This will override an event that
#'                       stops probabilistically via `spreadProb`, but forcing
#'                       its last set of active cells to try again to find neighbours.
#'                       It will try `maxRetriesPerID` times per event, before giving up.
#'                       During those `maxRetriesPerID` times, it will try to "jump" up to
#'                       4 cells outwards from each of the active cells, every 5 retries.\cr
#'   `iterations` \tab This is a hard cap on the number of internal iterations to
#'                          complete before returning the current state of the system
#'                          as a `data.table`.\cr
#' }
#'
#' @param landscape Required. A `RasterLayer` object. This defines the possible
#'                  locations for spreading events to start and `spread2` into. Required.
#'
#' @param start Required. Either a vector of pixel numbers to initiate spreading, or a
#'              `data.table` that is the output of a previous `spread2`.
#'              If a vector, they should be cell indices (pixels) on the `landscape`.
#'              If user has x and y coordinates, these can be converted with
#'              [`cellFromXY()`][terra::cellFromXY].
#'
#' @param spreadProb  Numeric of length 1 or length `ncell(landscape)` or
#'                    a `RasterLayer` that is the identical dimensions as
#'                    `landscape`.
#'                    If numeric of length 1, then this is the global (absolute)
#'                    probability of spreading into each cell from a neighbour.
#'                    If a numeric of length `ncell(landscape)` or a raster,
#'                    then this must be the cell-specific (absolute)
#'                    probability of a "receiving" potential cell. Default is `0.23`.
#'                    If relative probabilities are required, use `spreadProbRel`.
#'                    If used together, then the relative probabilities will be
#'                    re-scaled so that the mean relative probability of potential
#'                    neighbours is equal to the mean of `spreadProb` of
#'                    the potential neighbours.
#'
#' @param persistProb Numeric of length 1 or `RasterLayer`.
#'                    If numeric of length 1, then this is the global (absolute)
#'                    probability of cell continuing to burn per time step.
#'                    If a raster, then this must be the cell-specific (absolute)
#'                    probability of a fire persisting.
#'                    Default is `NA`, which is the same as 0, i.e. a cell only burns
#'                    for one time step.
#'
#' @param spreadProbRel Optional `RasterLayer` indicating a surface of relative
#'                      probabilities useful when using `neighProbs` (which
#'                      provides a mechanism for selecting a specific number of
#'                      cells at each iteration).
#'                      This indicates the relative probabilities for the selection
#'                      of successful neighbours.
#'                      `spreadProb` will still be evaluated *after*
#'                      the relative probabilities and `neighProbs` has been
#'                      evaluated, i.e., potential cells will be identified, then
#'                      some could be rejected via `spreadProb`.
#'                      If absolute `spreadProb` is not desired,
#'                      *be sure to set* `spreadProb = 1`.
#'                      Ignored if `neighProbs` is not provided.
#'
#' @param asRaster Logical, length 1. If `TRUE`, the function will return a `Raster`
#'                 where raster non NA values indicate the cells that were "active", and the
#'                 value is the initial starting pixel.
#'
#' @param maxSize  Numeric. Maximum number of cells for a single or all events to be `spread2`.
#'                 Recycled to match `start` length, if it is not as long as `start`.
#'                 This will be overridden if `exactSize` also provided.
#'                 See section on 'Breaking out of `spread2` events'.
#'
#' @param exactSize Numeric vector, length 1 or `length(start)`.
#'                  Similar to `maxSize`, but these will be the exact
#'                  final sizes of the events.  i.e., the `spread2` events
#'                  will continue until they are `floor(exactSize)`.
#'                  This will override `maxSize` if both provided.
#'                  See Details.
#'
#' @param directions    The number adjacent cells in which to look;
#'                      default is 8 (Queen case). Can only be 4 or 8.
#'
#' @param iterations    Number of iterations to `spread2`.
#'                      Leaving this `NULL` allows the `spread2` to continue
#'                      until stops spreading itself (i.e., exhausts itself).
#'
#' @param returnDistances Logical. Should the function include a column with the
#'                      individual cell distances from the locus where that event
#'                      started. Default is FALSE. See Details.
#'
#' @param returnDirections Logical. Should the function include a column with the
#'                      individual directions (in radians) from the locus where
#'                      that event started. Default is FALSE.
#'
#' @param returnFrom Logical. Should the function return a column with the
#'                      source, i.e, the lag 1 "from" pixel, for each iteration.
#'
#' @param circle  Logical. If TRUE, then outward `spread2` will be by equidistant rings,
#'                rather than solely by adjacent cells (via `directions` arg.).
#'                Default is `FALSE`.
#'                Using `circle = TRUE` can be dramatically slower for large problems.
#'                Note, this will likely create unexpected results if `spreadProb < 1`.
#'
#' @param skipChecks Logical. If TRUE, the argument checking (i.e., assertions) will be
#'              skipped. This should likely only be used once it is clear that the function
#'              arguments are well understood and function speed is of the primary importance.
#'              This is likely most useful in repeated iteration cases i.e., if this call
#'              is using the previous output from this same function.
#'
#' @param neighProbs An optional numeric vector, whose sum is 1.
#'                   It indicates the probabilities that an individual spread iteration
#'                   will spread to `1, 2, ..., length(neighProbs)` neighbours, respectively.
#'                   If this is used (i.e., something other than `NA`), `circle` and
#'                   `returnDistances` will not work currently.
#' @param maxRetriesPerID Only active if `exactSize` is used. This is the number of attempts
#'                        that will be made per event ID, before abandoning, therefore completing
#'                        the `spread2` for that event with a size that is smaller than
#'                        `exactSize`. Default 10 times.
#'
#' @param asymmetry     A numeric or `RasterLayer` indicating the ratio of the
#'                      asymmetry to be used. i.e., 1 is no asymmetry; 2 means that the
#'                      angles in the direction of the `asymmetryAngle` are 2x the
#'                      `spreadProb`
#'                      of the angles opposite tot he `asymmetryAngle`  Default is
#'                      NA, indicating no asymmetry. See details. This is still experimental.
#'                      Use with caution.
#'
#' @param asymmetryAngle A numeric or `RasterLayer` indicating the angle in degrees
#'                      (0 is "up", as in North on a map),
#'                      that describes which way the `asymmetry` is.
#' @param allowOverlap `numeric` (`logical` will work for backwards compatibility).
#'                     See details.  Default is 0, i.e., no overlapping.
#'
#' @param oneNeighbourOnly Logical. Default is `FALSE`. If `TRUE`, then this
#'                         spread algorithm will allow exactly one neighbour to be
#'                         spread to (not fewer or more). This could be used, e.g.,
#'                         for an animal moving. If this is `TRUE`, then `allowOverlap`
#'                         will be set to `2` if it is `0` or `1`.
#'
#' @param plot.it If `TRUE`, then plot the raster at every iteration,
#'                so one can watch the `spread2` event grow.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' If `maxSize` or `exactSize` are used, then spreading will continue and stop
#' before or at `maxSize` or at `exactSize`, respectively.
#' If `iterations` is specified, then the function will end, and the returned `data.table`
#' may (if `maxSize`) or will (if `exactSize`) have at least one active
#' cell per event that did not already achieve `maxSize` or `exactSize`.
#' This will be very useful to build new, customized higher-level wrapper functions that
#' iteratively call `spread2`.
#'
#' @note
#' `exactSize` may not be achieved if there aren't enough cells in the map.
#' Also, `exactSize` may not be achieved because the active cells are "stuck",
#' i.e., they have no inactivated cells to move to; or the `spreadProb` is low.
#' In the latter two cases, the algorithm will retry again, but it will only
#' retry from the last iteration's active cells.
#' The algorithm will only retry 10 times before quitting.
#' Currently, there will also be an attempt to "jump" up to four cells away from
#' the active cells to try to continue spreading.
#'
#' A common way to use this function is to build wrappers around this, followed
#' by iterative calls in a `while` loop. See example.
#'
#' @section Building custom spreading events:
#'
#' This function can be used iteratively, with relatively little overhead compared to using
#' it non-iteratively. In general, this function can be called with arguments set as user
#' needs, and with specifying e.g., `iterations = 1`. This means that the function will spread
#' outwards 1 iteration, then stop. The returned object will be a `data.table` or
#' `RasterLayer` that can be passed immediately back as the start argument into a subsequent
#' call to `spread2`. This means that every argument can be updated at each iteration.
#'
#' When using this function iteratively, there are several things to keep in mind.
#' The output will likely be sorted differently than the input (i.e., the
#' order of start, if a vector, may not be the same order as that returned).
#' This means that when passing the same object back into the next iteration of the
#' function call, `maxSize` or `exactSize` may not be in the same order.
#' To get the same order, the easiest thing to do is sort the initial `start`
#' objects by their pixel location, increasing.
#' Then, of course, sorting any vectorized arguments (e.g., `maxSize`) accordingly.
#'
#' **NOTE**: the `data.table` or `RasterLayer` should not be altered
#' when passed back into `spread2`.
#'
#' @section `allowOverlap`:
#' If `1` (or `TRUE`),
#'  then individual events can overlap with one another, i.e., allow
#'  overlap between events. If `2` (or `NA`), then each pixel
#'  is essentially independent, allowing overlap between and within
#'  events. This likely requires a user to intervene as it is possible
#'  to spread back onto itself. If `3` (did not exist previously),
#'  individual events can overlap, and there can be overlap within an
#'  event, but only within an iteration, i.e., once an iteration is
#'  finished, and a pixel was activated, then the spreading will not
#'  return onto these pixels. If `0` (or `FALSE`), then once a
#'  pixel is activated, it cannot be re-activated, within or between event.
#'  This allows events to not interfere with one another i.e.,
#'  they do not interact (this is slower than if
#'  `allowOverlap = FALSE`). Default is 0. In the case of 2 or 3,
#'  this would be, perhaps, useful for dispersal of,
#'  say, insect swarms.
#'
#' @return
#' Either a `data.table` (`asRaster=FALSE`) or a `RasterLayer`
#' (`asRaster=TRUE`, the default).
#' The `data.table` will have one attribute named `spreadState`, which
#' is a list containing a `data.table` of current cluster-level information
#' about the spread events.
#' If `asRaster=TRUE`, then the `data.table` (with its `spreadState`
#' attribute) will be attached to the `Raster` as an attribute named `pixel` as it
#' provides pixel-level information about the spread events.
#'
#' The `RasterLayer` represents every cell in which a successful `spread2` event occurred.
#' For the case of, say, a fire this would represent every cell that burned.
#' If `allowOverlap` is `TRUE`, the return will always be a `data.table`.
#'
#' If `asRaster` is `FALSE`, then this function returns a
#' `data.table` with 3 (or 4 if `returnFrom` is `TRUE`) columns:
#'
#' \tabular{ll}{
#'   `initialPixels` \tab the initial cell number of that particular
#'                            `spread2` event.\cr
#'   `pixels` \tab The cell indices of cells that have
#'                        been touched by the `spread2` algorithm.\cr
#'   `state` \tab a logical indicating whether the cell is active (i.e.,
#'                        could still be a source for spreading) or not (no
#'                        spreading will occur from these cells).\cr
#'   `from` \tab The pixel indices that were the immediately preceding
#'                    "source" for each `pixels`, i.e., the lag 1 pixels.
#'                    Only returned if `returnFrom` is `TRUE` \cr
#' }
#'
#' The attribute saved with the name `"spreadState"` (e.g., `attr(output, "spreadState")`)
#' includes a `data.table` with columns:
#' \tabular{ll}{
#'   `id` \tab An arbitrary code, from 1 to `length(start)` for each "event".\cr
#'   `initialPixels` \tab the initial cell number of that particular
#'                            `spread2` event.\cr
#'   `numRetries` \tab The number of re-starts the event did because it got
#'                          stuck (normally only because `exactSize` was used
#'                          and was not achieved.\cr
#'   `maxSize` \tab The number of pixels that were provided as inputs via
#'                      `maxSize` or `exactSize`.\cr
#'   `size` \tab The current size, in pixels, of each event.\cr
#' }
#' and several other objects that provide significant speed ups in iterative calls to
#' `spread2`. If the user runs `spread2` iteratively, there will likely be significant
#' speed gains if the `data.table` passed in to `start` should have the attribute
#' attached, or re-attached if it was lost, e.g., via
#' `setattr(outInput, "spreadState", attr(out, "spreadState"))`, where `out` is the
#' returned `data.table` from the previous call to `spread2`, and `outInput` is
#' the modified `data.table`. Currently, the modified `data.table` **must** have the
#' same order as `out`.
