This Git repository uses the [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model (the [`git flow`](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh) extension is useful for this).
The [`development`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES.tools/tree/development) branch contains the latest contributions and other code that will appear in the next release, and the [`master`](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES.tools) branch contains the code of the latest release, which is exactly what is currently on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SpaDES.tools).

To make a contribution to the package, just send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). 
When you send your PR, make sure `development` is the destination branch on the [grainscape repository](https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES.tools).
Your PR should pass `R CMD check --as-cran`, which will also be checked by <a href="https://travis-ci.org/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES.tools">Travis CI</a> and <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/achubaty/spades-tools">AppVeyor CI</a> when the PR is submitted.

We'll try to review your pull request and provide feedback / merge improvements as quickly as possible.

Thank you!
